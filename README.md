# Python project #1 - BIDS17
## Weather forecast
yoramfeld@gmail.com

The code uses an API key that I generated on openweathermap site and it 
calls the site with a city name that the user enters.
If multiple cities match the city name, the user will be able to choose
from them and see the weather in each of them.
