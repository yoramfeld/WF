# Python project #1 - BIU DS17
## Weather forecast
yoramfeld@gmail.com

The code uses an API key that I generated on openweathermap site and it 
calls the site with a city name that the user enters and later in the code with location data 
to get the weather data in that location and the relative timezone.
If multiple cities match the city name, the user will be able to choose
from them and get the weather for the selected location.
